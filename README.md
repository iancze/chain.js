Quick and easy web plots of MCMC samples: [Website](http://iancze.github.io/chain.js/)

Do you frequently run long MCMC chains on a cluster? Would you like to periodically check up on their progress?

Using *chain.js*, you can use your browser to watch your MCMC algorithm sample in realtime.

Simply modify your MCMC code to append your parameters to a CSV file and use the browser to plot them.

For an example of how to modify your MCMC code to use `chain.js`, see `make_samples.py`.
